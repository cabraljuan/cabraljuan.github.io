Determinants of the rental/sale price of real estate before and after Covid-19: Case study for the AMBA region, Argentina </a>
          <br> 
         With Mariana Bernad and Guido Sanchez
           <br>
           <b>Abstract</b>: This paper studies the change in the weight of the different price determinants for real estate in AMBA before and after Covid-19.
        It is found that certain common services (such as gyms, swimming pools) have less influence on the price of apartments in times of quarantine compared 
        to before quarantine. Also, we found an increase in those properties with uncovered square meters.

        Snowblind:  Short and Medium-Term Effects of a cocaine Supply Shock </a>
           <br>
           <b>Abstract</b>: This work seeks to analyze the effects of an increase 
            in the supply of cocaine using an exogenous increase shock in São Miguel Island, 
            Portugal as a case study. São Miguel is located in the archipelago 
            of the Azores which is politically organized as an autonomous region that
            includes nine islands. In January 2001, half a ton of cocaine reached the shores of the island of São Miguel.
            According to news reports, this event was a trigger for many changes on the island, such as an increase the number
            of active drug dealers and an extreme reduction in the price of the drug. Through Synthetic Control, 
            I seek to study the short and medium-term impact of an increase in the availability of cocaine in São Miguel on crime,
            unemployment, and health.

        Understanding unsolved crimes hotspots:  a spatial approach </a>
           <br>
           <b>Abstract</b>: This paper aims to investigate unsolved crime hotspots through a spatial approach. 
                    We use data from more than 52,000 homicides that took place over the past decade in America's largest cities. 
                    Common tests are carried out to detect the presence of spatial dependence, and spatial mapping and modeling tools are used. 
                    The analysis carried out is intended to be useful to understand and prevent those crimes that are not solved.

        Does gender make a difference?  A labor demand analysis from an online job board </a>
          <br> 
         With Matías Douelle and María Fernandez
           <br>
           <b>Abstract</b>: This paper seeks to analyze gender 
            differences in job demand through data obtained from 
            two websites that are widely used in Argentina both 
            by people who demand employment and those who offer employment.
            Through a LASSO and L1 penalization logit analysis, the results 
            suggest that there are differences in the words that are used in the description of job ads.

        What is the reach of the credibility revolution? </a>
          
          <br> 
         With Florencia Pucci
           <br>
           <b>Abstract</b>: In the last 25 years, there has been an abrupt change in the methodology followed by economists. 
           Authors like Angrist and Pischke call this change the “credibility revolution”. 
           This revolution consists of the use of experimental or quasi-experimental 
           methods and mainly reached the high impact academic journals of Economics such as The Quarterly Journal of Economics,
           American Economic Review and Econometrica, among others. Until now, the scope of the revolution has not been analyzed in 
           academic journals associated with heterodox economics schools. The objective of this article is to explore with a bibliometric analysis 
           if there was a similar change in journals with the main influence of the Marxist, Austrian, and Post-Keynesian school of thought. 
           The result of this exercise suggests that this type of journal did not witness a credibility revolution as such.
           Finally, we explore the reasons why this result occurs.
